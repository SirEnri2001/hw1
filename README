Which parts of this assignment were the hardest, and/or took the most time?
I encountered an unexpected behavior when using BufferedReader and PushbackReader. When I read the header lines using BufferedReader, the body lines will be read and stored in internal buffer of BufferedReader. So I have to switch back to use InputStream and read byte by byte.

Optional: Do you have any suggestions for improving this assignment?
Although we don't have to implement a complete HTTP server according to RFC document, we still have some of the problems in specifications. For example, when an HTTP error code is sent, Server can either shut down the connection or remain for next header. Also, we have to consider "Connection" item in header. In the test, we don't have this item set as "keep-alive", but we do need to persist the connection.
